At StrikeSecLive, we specialize in helping development teams embed security into their DNA. Through live web application penetration testing sessions, hands-on workshops, and tailored secure coding training, we transform security from a checkbox into a culture. Our approach ensures your developers understand real-world attack techniques and how to defend against them—before vulnerabilities reach production.

Whether you’re building APIs, deploying microservices, or managing complex supply chains, StrikeSecLive equips your team with the skills and confidence to deliver secure, resilient applications.
